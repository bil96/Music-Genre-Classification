# Music-Genre-Classification
Music Genre Classification with PCA,employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. By transforming the abundant features into principal components
streamline the data, making it more manageable and revealing patterns that are not immediately obvious in the raw data. The principal components you’ve derived will form the foundation for the next step in the project—employing a supervised machine learning algorithm, with a focus on the well-known logistic regression technique.
